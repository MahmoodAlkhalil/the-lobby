  "Welcome wanderer! It's... curious that you've arrived. We’re not entirely sure how you got here, perhaps the DNS record was whispered into the wrong ear, or maybe you stumbled upon the URL out in the wild, tucked somewhere it shouldn’t have been.",
  "Whatever the path, intentional or accidental, here you are. And now that you're here, there's no need to explain.",
  "The Lobby isn’t a place that asks questions. It simply exists quietly, deliberately. A space between spaces. Let the calm wash over you, let the echoes of Qur'anic verses wrap around your senses as they gently fill the air. You don’t have to do anything. Just listen. Just be.",
  "Not everything needs to make sense right away. Some doors open without a key. Some lobbies weren’t meant to be found, yet somehow, you did. Welcome."
